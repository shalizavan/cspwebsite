   <h1>My first project in APCSP 2022-23 was to create a small interactive safari park drawing using the python turtle module.</h1>
   <h1>The project first creates a truck on a safari background. It then prompts the user to choose a direction.</h1>
   <h1>Depending on the direction chosen, an image of a lion or elephant will be displayed.</h1>
   <h1>This project uses the replit console so a fork (separate copy) is necessary for running the prompts.</h1>
